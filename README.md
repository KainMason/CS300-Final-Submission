# Portfolio - Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

In this portfolio, I have documented my work on two key projects that explore the concepts of data structures and algorithms. The projects focus on analyzing runtime and memory usage for various data structures and implementing algorithms to manipulate and organize data effectively. The goal was to understand how different data structures influence the performance of a program and to gain hands-on experience in sorting, searching, and organizing data efficiently.

## Problem Solving in the Projects

### Project One - Analyzing Data Structures
In this project, I was tasked with analyzing different data structures and understanding their runtime and memory usage. I explored structures like arrays, vectors, and maps, considering how they perform when dealing with large datasets. The main challenge was to compare the performance of each structure and determine the best one for specific tasks. The outcome of this project was an analysis that allowed me to evaluate which data structure to use depending on the scenario.

### Project Two - Sorting and Printing Course Data
For Project Two, I worked on a program that loads course data from a file, sorts it in alphanumeric order, and prints out a list of the courses. The task involved loading a CSV file, parsing the data, and storing it in a structure that could efficiently organize and retrieve course information. The primary data structure I used was a `map`, which allowed me to store courses by their course number and access them quickly. The project focused on implementing sorting algorithms to ensure that the courses were listed in the correct order.

## Approach to the Problem

The primary approach in both projects was to understand and leverage the right data structures for the task at hand. In Project Two, for instance, using a `map` to store course data helped me access and sort the data easily, which was essential when dealing with large datasets. I focused on breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable pieces, testing each function, and troubleshooting any issues that arose. This approach made the development process smoother and helped me understand the importance of using efficient data structures in programming.

## Overcoming Roadblocks

One of the major roadblocks I encountered was when handling file input in Project Two. Parsing the data from a CSV file and ensuring that the format was correct required careful handling. I had to spend a lot of time debugging and testing the file input function to ensure that it could handle different formats and cases. Once I solved this issue, the rest of the program fell into place. Additionally, sorting the course data and ensuring that the program ran efficiently with larger datasets was another challenge. I had to fine-tune the sorting algorithm to ensure optimal performance.

## Expanding My Approach to Designing Software

This project has really expanded my approach to software design by teaching me the importance of choosing the right data structures. Before starting, I didnâ€™t realize how much of an impact the choice of data structures could have on the performance of a program. Now, I think more critically about which structure to use based on the problem at hand. Additionally, I've learned how to design code that is modular, where each function is focused on a specific task. This makes the program easier to maintain and adapt in the future.

## Evolving My Approach to Writing Maintainable and Adaptable Code

Throughout the projects, I have focused on writing code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. By breaking the code into smaller, more manageable functions and clearly organizing my thoughts, I made the code easier to read and understand. The use of functions and modular design not only made the code cleaner but also made it much easier to update and expand in the future. These lessons will influence how I approach future projects, as I now prioritize writing clear, concise, and efficient code that can easily be modified or improved over time.

## Conclusion

These projects have been instrumental in helping me understand data structures and algorithms in a practical context. They have deepened my understanding of how to approach problems involving data manipulation and organization. Additionally, they have provided valuable insights into writing efficient, maintainable, and adaptable code. I am confident that the skills I have developed will be invaluable as I continue to develop my programming and software design abilities.
